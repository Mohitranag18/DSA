# DSA

Welcome to my DSA Progress Tracker repository! 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through various coding platforms. My goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and share my progress with the community.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder is dedicated to a specific data structure or important concept.
- Inside each folder, you will find:
  - **Problem Links:** Links to the problems I solved from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank.
  - **Solutions:** My solutions for the problems in Java.

## 📌 Platforms Covered
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

## 🎯 Goal
- Solve DSA problems daily.
- Share consistent progress.
- Help others learn DSA through structured solutions.

## 🤝 Contributions
Feel free to contribute by sharing your problem-solving strategies or optimizing existing solutions!
